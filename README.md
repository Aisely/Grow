# Le BootCamp Grow
Open-source website and codebase for the Grow community.
> This site is a version made for pre-launch. We are also working on a more complete site - the main website.

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our developer bootcamp landing page project! This repository contains all the code and assets necessary to build and deploy our platform's pre-launch landing page.

Our developer bootcamp platform is dedicated to helping French-speaking Africans become world-class software engineers and tech entrepreneurs. Our landing page is designed to showcase our mission and invite visitors to join our community.

Feel free to explore our code and make contributions to help us improve our platform. Thank you for your interest in our project!
